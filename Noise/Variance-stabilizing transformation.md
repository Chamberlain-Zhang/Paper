## The Noise Model

A camera sensor converts the photons hitting the pixel area during the exposure time into a digitized luminance map.
As shown in the photon transfer pipeline shown in Fig. 2, this process contains multiple stages, where each stage introduces speciﬁc noise. 
Let us ﬁrst consider an ideal system with no noise. Under the linear camera model, at each pixel, the sensor conversion is a linear ampliﬁcation as: 

$$
\equalignno{x^\astar = g\alpha u^\astar}
$$
