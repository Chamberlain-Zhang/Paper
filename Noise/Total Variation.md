## Isotropic and Anisotropic TV
TV is essentially the L1 of the gradient magnitude. The gradient magnitude can be defined in several ways.
The two most common ones are using the Euclidean norm and the   L1  norm. In the Euclidean 2D case we have

$$
|\nabla u|_{2}=\sqrt{\left(u_{x}\right)^{2}+\left(u_{y}\right)^{2}}
$$

In the L1 case we have

$$
|\nabla u|_{2} = |{u_{x}|+|u_{y}|
$$

$$
u = 4
$$
